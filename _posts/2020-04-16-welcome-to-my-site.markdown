Hi internet users, I am starting this site to connect and discuss with you all. I am a Software engineer and a technology enthusiast. I will mainly talk about distributed systems and blockchain. I hope that you will email me, or use other connect platforms to chat and discuss about Blockchain, Software development, Photography or life in general.

I will also regularly post about the projects I am doing. And would love to get your suggestions to improve the end result.
