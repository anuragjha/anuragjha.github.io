In times like these. One wonders about the inequality in social welfare in different parts of the world, even dripping down to different parts of the city. Over the centuries, humanity has tried to improve human existence on this wonderful planet.
Recent events have made it very important to enable easy access to healthcare for everyone. Making Basic income available to everyone. Enable every person to purchase essential goods and services. And do all this as a collective representation of society.
We want a trustable, decentralized and fraud proof network that can enable the above mentioned. We have Blockchain.
The time of the blockchain is now! The blockchain community has already leveraged full-time availability of the network, convenient payment system, transparent rules and decisions, trustful and anti-fraud governance model to build a network for providing basic income. This will also enable health insurance for one in society. More power to the blockchain community.
Please wash your hands and maintain physical distance. We will beat this virus. Let us also take a moment to express our gratitude to everyone still working to make our lives civil. Godspeed.
